# Infosys-milestone


The best way to present our work through the PPT is to give a simple and easily understandable explanation of what our roles were, what we have done, and how we have done the work. So if I have to tell you in a simple way you can include our project details of what it does, then what were our roles are and how we have divided the work in this project, and what does it actually include. We can add more things like how does it helps in many applications of our life, and what are its advantages and disadvantages, or using this, and if there is a way to improve it, how can we do it. Each slide can be presented in a simple and professional form.
