ii ii ii# Infosys-milestone


The best way to present our work through the PPT is to give a simple and easily understandable explanation of what our roles were, what we have done, and how we have done the work. So if I have to tell you in a simple way you can include our project details of what it does, then what were our roles are and how we have divided the work in this project, and what does it actually include. We can add more things like how does it helps in many applications of our life, and what are its advantages and disadvantages, or using this, and if there is a way to improve it, how can we do it. Each slide can be presented in a simple and professional form.


#ppt making
 i thought of including
 Title Slide 
Introduction
Objective – Why we are analyzing this dataset (better patient care, operational efficiency, prediction, etc.).
Dataset Description – Source (Kaggle), size, key features/attributes.
Data Preprocessing – Cleaning, handling missing values, feature selection.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Charts/graphs showing patient distribution, age groups, disease trends, admission rates.
Machine Learning / Analysis Methods – Regression, classification, or clustering approaches applied (depending on dataset).
Results & Insights – Key findings from the data (trends, predictions, efficiency improvements).
Applications for Infosys in Healthcare – How Infosys can leverage this analysis for digital transformation, hospital management solutions, predictive analytics.
Conclusion & Future Scope – Summarize insights and mention possible future work.
Q&A Slide – Thank you + Questions.* and should i include all our team member names right


yep include them at the start of the ppt after the project name, otherwise you can include a seperate slide right before the Thank you slide and also include what each member did(this is optional).




ok fine. i will include what i have told before

Ok!!


I have uploaded the ppt once can you check


The ppt is great, but i think you can also add another slide after the advantages and put in some other applications where this metho can be used and help in other real world problems.

I thought of explaining it orally 

ok thats not a problem you can do it anyway you want. Have you prepared for the presentation??


Yeah but little tensed

Shivam what sir told

He said that the presentation was great and well prepared, the only issue was that you were facing a little network problem so he asked me to present the ppt dont worry overall you did great 

after this group??

Yes after this group.

ok.sorry for inconvience.its raining in my place and my wifi and signals both are having issues.

no dont worry everything is fine, evrything went well.

guys the github does not give any notifications if you guys dont have any problem would you like to share numbers

whats happeneing right now what did they say till now??

today sir is absent.so that sir told that ,today session that will take over by mam. then mam told to present the team 4 to present the project and now the team 5 doing there presentation

Bruh i messed up today i didnt see the time and i went to the hospital. 9951510421 this is my number if anyone have any doubts or questions just text me

And yes dont let sir or anyone know that i just shared my number or else i will be dead they will not leave me 

guys anyone run and get output for yesterday's semantic graphs program.If you run and get the output can share that code in this repo.

What need to do for the 3rd mildstone i didnt understand??

sorry guys i couldn't focus on what tasks sir gave us and what we need to do so if its possible can someone explain whats going on.

same i too didnt understand what kind of data collection need to do??What is our project is about

yaa same i dont even know what i have to do i only understood that i have to give the presentation


i think poojesh knows


poobeshh can you please help us two with whats happening

and also drop here what are their works too 

SaiTejaswi - data collection and preprocessing

Poobeshraj - Named Entity Recognition

Jahnavi - Semantic Map

Shivam - PPT

i know i have to do the presentation but what should i do the presentation about i dont even know the topic or the work for the milestone

same.others please respond otherwise we cant do

This is poobeshraj...sorry guys I can't see githuh...
3rd milestone is to do semantic map,
Work Flow  =>  collect data -> preprocess -> named entity recognition and relation extraction -> covert to triples -> semantic map this what sir told yesterday...
and also yesterday task is same as our milestone...
I think the works were splitted and mentioned above.
guys kindly mention ur names while text, so that is easy to identify you
for data collection , sir has mentioned some websites.
hope I shared everything what sir has told...
 
ok.This is Tejaswi. my work is to collect the data set and preprocess it.i have exam on Monday. is that okay if I do my work on monday.

This is poobesh. sure , if you have already collected ur dataset,just upload it in repo, if it possible I will do the preprocessing and also my work, orelse you can do it on monday...

Thanks poobesh I have exam tomorrow also my faculty told suddenly today I will upload dataset is it possible for you to make preprocessing?? Can you please help with this

This is Shivam, my work is ppt and presentation i think. poobesh can you tell me the topic and points like what we are using, why and everything in detail that i need to put in the ppt so i can make it look clear and proper for the presentation

Shivam is it possible for u to do preprocessing.because I have important exam that the only reason I am asking for help.

this is poobesh. shivam  the topics are data collection => preprocess =>  Named Entity Recognition => relation extraction => semantic graphs.. I that's all. we want to do it and also i had taken the screen shot of ppt, which sir has shown and explain in the class... if you want can i share that screenshot pdf

this is poobesh, tejaswi sir told that the data set contain 100+ or 200+ sentance in it .. I think so


ok I will send tonight

I would have really liked to help but me myself am going through a lot of projects and tomorrow i have a project expo and day after tomorrow Smart india hackathon round 2 for me, i am really sorry tejaswi. and poobesh can you share me the ppt pdf

guys once check if dataset if fine i will go with preprocessing

Pooboo share the pdf naa

i have uploaded the data set and preprocessing thing

shivam , the screenshot that I have taken I send it.check milestone3 pdf
 

is that data set is fine

This is poobesh ,in that dataset the sentance and _preprocessed_text coloum has end with the word sample, if i import that file and run code it shows "sample" word  as an entity...
i think i want to remove the word sample

yaa sorry I haven't seen that.

Guys could you specify what files are of milestone 3

In semantic_code.py we use it for codes and the dataset is not ready, the datasets => Infosys_dataset_expanded.csv and infosys_preprocessed_full.csv is not in the format... i think Tejaswi will modify that datasets

i have changed the dataset can you check is it fine??

is the dataset now called wikipedia??

yes
Removed unwanted characters → deleted strange/unicode symbols.
Normalized spaces → extra spaces/tabs collapsed into one space.
Lowercased → all words converted to lowercase for uniformity.
Kept useful punctuation → . , ; : ' " - ? ! () kept, others removed.
Sentence ending check → ensured each sentence ends with . . i have done this in preprocessing

can you tell me what is the dataset based on??

Famous scientists (Einstein, Marie Curie, Newton, Darwin, etc.)
Scientific theories (relativity, evolution, quantum mechanics, atomic theory, etc.)
Important historical events (World War I, Industrial Revolution, Renaissance, etc.)
Classic literature works (Hamlet, Don Quixote, Pride and Prejudice, etc.)
Notable places (Paris, London, Rome, New York, etc.)
Prestigious institutions (MIT, University of Cambridge, CERN, etc.)

this is poobesh, I had update the code in the semantic_code.py file, Jahnavi Lakshmi can you check the code Whether it is fine to do your part of the code...
Tejaswi, the dataset is fine, but if I import the dataset only 121 triples can be created , If you free can you check it by run the code...

guys can someone share any images of the output like the graph or something

i had complete the my work, that is  Named Entity Recognition and load the triples.. can i share the screenshot shivam

i think it contain some duplicates sentences. it is showing only once i guess

This is Jahnavi. Due to the heavy rains, im facing some issues with our home wifi and cant perform multiple tasks in laptop using mobile data. I will complete the semantic maps part and update the file by the end of the day. Is that ok?
