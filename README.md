# Infosys-milestone


The best way to present our work through the PPT is to give a simple and easily understandable explanation of what our roles were, what we have done, and how we have done the work. So if I have to tell you in a simple way you can include our project details of what it does, then what were our roles are and how we have divided the work in this project, and what does it actually include. We can add more things like how does it helps in many applications of our life, and what are its advantages and disadvantages, or using this, and if there is a way to improve it, how can we do it. Each slide can be presented in a simple and professional form.


#ppt making
 i thought of including
 Title Slide 
Introduction
Objective – Why we are analyzing this dataset (better patient care, operational efficiency, prediction, etc.).
Dataset Description – Source (Kaggle), size, key features/attributes.
Data Preprocessing – Cleaning, handling missing values, feature selection.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Charts/graphs showing patient distribution, age groups, disease trends, admission rates.
Machine Learning / Analysis Methods – Regression, classification, or clustering approaches applied (depending on dataset).
Results & Insights – Key findings from the data (trends, predictions, efficiency improvements).
Applications for Infosys in Healthcare – How Infosys can leverage this analysis for digital transformation, hospital management solutions, predictive analytics.
Conclusion & Future Scope – Summarize insights and mention possible future work.
Q&A Slide – Thank you + Questions.* and should i include all our team member names right


yep include them at the start of the ppt after the project name, otherwise you can include a seperate slide right before the Thank you slide and also include what each member did(this is optional).




ok fine. i will include what i have told before

The ppt is great, but i think you can also add another slide after the advantages and put in some other applications where this metho can be used and help in other real world problems.
