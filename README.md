What need to do for the 3rd mildstone i didnt understand??

sorry guys i couldn't focus on what tasks sir gave us and what we need to do so if its possible can someone explain whats going on.

same i too didnt understand what kind of data collection need to do??What is our project is about

yaa same i dont even know what i have to do i only understood that i have to give the presentation


i think poojesh knows


poobeshh can you please help us two with whats happening

and also drop here what are their works too 

SaiTejaswi - data collection and preprocessing

Poobeshraj - Named Entity Recognition

Jahnavi - Semantic Map

Shivam - PPT

i know i have to do the presentation but what should i do the presentation about i dont even know the topic or the work for the milestone

same.others please respond otherwise we cant do

This is poobeshraj...sorry guys I can't see githuh...
3rd milestone is to do semantic map,
Work Flow  =>  collect data -> preprocess -> named entity recognition and relation extraction -> covert to triples -> semantic map this what sir told yesterday...
and also yesterday task is same as our milestone...
I think the works were splitted and mentioned above.
guys kindly mention ur names while text, so that is easy to identify you
for data collection , sir has mentioned some websites.
hope I shared everything what sir has told...
 
ok.This is Tejaswi. my work is to collect the data set and preprocess it.i have exam on Monday. is that okay if I do my work on monday.

This is poobesh. sure , if you have already collected ur dataset,just upload it in repo, if it possible I will do the preprocessing and also my work, orelse you can do it on monday...

Thanks poobesh I have exam tomorrow also my faculty told suddenly today I will upload dataset is it possible for you to make preprocessing?? Can you please help with this

This is Shivam, my work is ppt and presentation i think. poobesh can you tell me the topic and points like what we are using, why and everything in detail that i need to put in the ppt so i can make it look clear and proper for the presentation

Shivam is it possible for u to do preprocessing.because I have important exam that the only reason I am asking for help.

this is poobesh. shivam  the topics are data collection => preprocess =>  Named Entity Recognition => relation extraction => semantic graphs.. I that's all. we want to do it and also i had taken the screen shot of ppt, which sir has shown and explain in the class... if you want can i share that screenshot pdf

this is poobesh, tejaswi sir told that the data set contain 100+ or 200+ sentance in it .. I think so


ok I will send tonight

I would have really liked to help but me myself am going through a lot of projects and tomorrow i have a project expo and day after tomorrow Smart india hackathon round 2 for me, i am really sorry tejaswi. and poobesh can you share me the ppt pdf

guys once check if dataset if fine i will go with preprocessing

Pooboo share the pdf naa

i have uploaded the data set and preprocessing thing

shivam , the screenshot that I have taken I send it.check milestone3 pdf
 

is that data set is fine

This is poobesh ,in that dataset the sentance and _preprocessed_text coloum has end with the word sample, if i import that file and run code it shows "sample" word  as an entity...
i think i want to remove the word sample

yaa sorry I haven't seen that.

Guys could you specify what files are of milestone 3

In semantic_code.py we use it for codes and the dataset is not ready, the datasets => Infosys_dataset_expanded.csv and infosys_preprocessed_full.csv is not in the format... i think Tejaswi will modify that datasets

i have changed the dataset can you check is it fine??

is the dataset now called wikipedia??

yes
Removed unwanted characters → deleted strange/unicode symbols.
Normalized spaces → extra spaces/tabs collapsed into one space.
Lowercased → all words converted to lowercase for uniformity.
Kept useful punctuation → . , ; : ' " - ? ! () kept, others removed.
Sentence ending check → ensured each sentence ends with . . i have done this in preprocessing

can you tell me what is the dataset based on??

Famous scientists (Einstein, Marie Curie, Newton, Darwin, etc.)
Scientific theories (relativity, evolution, quantum mechanics, atomic theory, etc.)
Important historical events (World War I, Industrial Revolution, Renaissance, etc.)
Classic literature works (Hamlet, Don Quixote, Pride and Prejudice, etc.)
Notable places (Paris, London, Rome, New York, etc.)
Prestigious institutions (MIT, University of Cambridge, CERN, etc.)

this is poobesh, I had update the code in the semantic_code.py file, Jahnavi Lakshmi can you check the code Whether it is fine to do your part of the code...
Tejaswi, the dataset is fine, but if I import the dataset only 121 triples can be created , If you free can you check it by run the code...

guys can someone share any images of the output like the graph or something

i had complete the my work, that is  Named Entity Recognition and load the triples.. can i share the screenshot shivam

i think it contain some duplicates sentences. it is showing only once i guess

This is Jahnavi. Due to the heavy rains, im facing some issues with our home wifi and cant perform multiple tasks in laptop using mobile data. I will complete the semantic maps part and update the file by the end of the day. Is that ok?

yes, may be it contain duplicates or not fit for triples... alright it has 121 triples.. whether it is fine

yaa fine

guys i am uploading the ppt for the 3rd milestone can you guys check on it 

i think if you add some photos it will be much better

This is Jahnavi. Shivam, I have completed the last part(Semantic Map generation) and updated the semantic_code.py file.
And for PPT the outputs of dataset and streamlit app, sematic map need to be added.
Should i share the screenshots of the app,semantic map or will you run the code and do it by yourself.

this is poobesh. Jahnavi, in that code execution " Enter your search query " is not appear , only Semantic map is shown.. i think the search box is not there , can you or anyone check with that code... 

this is jahnavi. yeah i will add the search box and update the code by afternoon.

yeah, fine.

This is Jahnavi. I have updated the code to include the search box and print the top 5 matchs. Can anyone check whether it is fine.

this is poobesh, it's okay, others also can check it.. Jahnavi, when we search the query in the search box, then the semantic map will appear.. right.. but the semantic map is appeared before we search the qurey... whether it is okay or not....

This is Jahnavi. I think semantic map is a graphical representation of the triples. Here we are just adding an extra feature for searching the top 5 matches. So i think its ok to represent it before the search and after the search by highliting the nodes. Others also can check and confirm if its ok or not.

This is Tejaswi. I think it's fine

this is poobesh. alright, it's okay..

guys what changes should i make in the ppt

for PPT the outputs of dataset and streamlit app, sematic map need to be added.
Should i share the screenshots of the app,semantic map or will you run the code and do it by yourself. this was sent by jahnavi once check and change ppt

share the screenshots i will make the changes 

@jahnavi

This is jahnavi. I have uploaded the screenshots. Everyone check once and tell me if there is anything i can add.

guys have a look at the ppt i have made the changes and added only 2 screeshots as we need to keep it minimal


can you send the roles of yours for 4th milestone??
Tejaswi -ppt

Poobeshraj => Deployment

Jahnavi - Query answering and domain linking

poobesh or jahnavi can any one tell what need to do for milestone 4 I didn't understand when sir told

we want to do the 1.centrality and community 2. Query answering and domain linking 3. Deployment 4. ppt
i think we want to use the same milestone 3 code for the milestone 4... and add the milestone 4 models... whether it is right!!!

guys... we can do the code in milestone4_code.py... it is okay

okay

can you share the pics what are things shoulld include in ppt 

did shivam completed 1st part?

Jahnavi.. i can upload a sample code file.. in that i update the milestone 4 model... if it is okay you can copy that code into the milestone3_code.py file

i have upload the sample6.py code file.... can any one check that code, whether it is okay

Everything is fine but i think the answer to the query should be in text formate but its showing in table format. Is that OK? if not i will change the formate to text.

yeah!!.. can you change the formate and update in milestone4_code.py file and than delete sample6.py file

and for using previous dataset triples the streamlit app is showing "no strong semantic links found." for cross domain linking.

Jahnavi... can you check the code again in sample6.py file from 217th line... i have update it... if you want to do any changes.. you can made the changes and update it

in that code there is no query answering section. I have updated the sample6.py code from the end of 2nd code. Once have a look whether it is write or not. If its ok i will update the milestone4_code.py

once done can you add output images so that i will include them in ppt

Jahnavi... I think it is okay.. whether others also verify it..
Jahnavi... can you update that code in milestone4_code.py

Okay i have updated milestone4_code.py. Shivam and tejaswi once check and conform is there anything to change or add.
and tejaswi i think it will be better if you run the code on your laptop and take the screenshot based on the ppt requirement and space available. If you have any issues while running the code then i will share the screenshots


I have classes till 5. I’ve already completed the theory part of the PPT and just need to do some editing. I don’t have enough time, which is why I asked you to share the screenshots.

ok. i will upload screenshots.

Thank you so much jahnavi

I have uploaded the screenshots ms41-ms46 . Once check

haa.

i have uploaded the ppt once any one can check whether it is fine or not

guys i am sorry for the late response but i think i wont be able to do my role i am having my mid term exams this week and today was the first exam. So i was hoping for any one of you gugys to complete my work for me. i am really sorry guys for the late info.

and to be honest i dont even know what to do in my role. i am really sorry guys for this. i promise i will do it better the next time. please cover for me in this work this once

This is Jahnavi. Shivam the project is done. Are you attending todays class? Sir said everyone needs to explain their part of the PPT. If you've taken permission to skip, let us know quickly so one of us can prepare your section. We just need to be sure before class starts.
And Tejaswi in slide-1 heading insted of 'Cross domain' it was typed 'Domain domain'. After 'query answering' next topic should be 'Domain linking' and then deployment i think. Please make those changes and remaining part is fine for me. 

ok I will do and let u know. and in slide 1 are you telling about main heading??

yes main heading

Milestone 4 – Deployment, Query Answering & Domain Linking i kept this one right??

Is it? when i downloaded and checked the ppt "Domain" was showed twice. May be it is due to formating change. If its fine in your ppt its fine leave it. But Add "Cross Domain Linking" instead of "Domain linking". and for the output of domain linking section i have uploaded another ss. please delete the previous output and add the new output.


Okay. Could you tell me which slides I should explain. 
jahnavi i made the changes can you check once.


This is shivam, unfortunately, i won't be able to attend not just today but the whole week. i have already informed sir yesterday, but if you guys want to be assured, i will join at 8 and tell sir again and leave. i am really sorry guys, and thank you so much jahnavi for completing my work too, i am really sorry i counld help you guys

Ok shivam . Tejaswi since you only have introduction to explain, can you explain shivams part of ppt also?

yeah sure.the ppt is fine right

yeah its fine

okay. now i need to tell upto centrality and community right??

yes

janhavi be ready with the output.i will share the ppt

now we want to mail two links... right

yes

who will do ppt for final review and also tell me the problem statement for our project, so that i will do our documentation...

This is Saitejaswi. i am doing the ppt. in the final ppt we have to take the wikipedia data set and dataprocessing, ner etc.... right?? . i include the some matter and the output. is that fine or should i add more.or you can share ur thoughts ..

now you want to change the dataset right.... but i need the problem statement

 i think no need to change right??

I think we need to change the dataset. Because the triples are not so meaningfull. Once check them and finalize whether we need to change the dataset or not.

if we change the dataset.we need to change everything right??

ok then lets not change the dataset.

haa.it is fine right??

this is poobesh... sir told , what i want to do now.. here is some network issuse

sir asked you to create a group repository and add MIT license.

it is already created by shivam.. it is right

jahnavi can you share your thoughts to make the ppt.

I think we need to create another repository to include all the milestone codes and all.this repository is containing all right like our conversations, screenshots, sample codes and all. 
Tejaswi can you change the template of the ppt. because i think its too simple when compared with other teams. Matter is fine.

ok fine

guys anyone give me our problem statement..because i want to do the documentation....
whether anyone create new repo and add other members.. here is some network isuse i am unable to create it
